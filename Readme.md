## Overview

The goal is to recommend complete outfits to customers by leveraging:

1) Retailer Catalog Data: Access to the retailer's product catalog.
2) Social Media Fashion Images: Using images from social media to identify trending outfits.
3) Clothing Item Extraction: Using models like SegFormer-clothes to detect and segment clothing items in images.
4) Embeddings and Vector Databases: Using models like CLIP to create embeddings of images and store them for similarity searches.
5) Knowledge Graph Enhancement: Strengthening the relationships (edges) in the knowledge graph based on social media data.
6) Outfit Generation: Recommending outfits from the retailer's catalog based on the knowledge graph and embeddings.


## Detailed Workflow
### 1. Data Acquisition
#### 1.1 Retailer Catalog Data
Product Images: High-quality images of each item.
Product Metadata: Attributes like category, color, style, season, price, etc.
#### 1.2 Social Media Fashion Images
Data Source: Collect fashion images from platforms like Instagram, Pinterest.
Compliance: Ensure adherence to platform policies and privacy regulations.
### 2. Clothing Item Extraction from Images
#### 2.1 Using SegFormer-clothes Model
Purpose: Detect and segment individual clothing items within an image.
Process:
Input: Fashion images from social media.
Output: Segmented images of individual clothing items.
Benefits:
Fine-Grained Analysis: Allows for precise identification of each clothing item.
Improved Embeddings: Better quality inputs for embedding models.
### 3. Creating Image Embeddings
#### 3.1 Using CLIP or Similar Models
Purpose: Convert images (and associated text) into embeddings in a shared vector space.
Process:
Input: Segmented clothing item images.
Output: Embedding vectors representing each item.
Benefits:
Semantic Understanding: Captures visual and textual semantics.
Similarity Search: Enables finding similar items based on embeddings.
#### 3.2 Storing in a Vector Database
Database Options: Use vector databases like FAISS, Pinecone, or Milvus.
Purpose: Efficient storage and retrieval of high-dimensional embedding vectors.
Functionality:
Similarity Search: Quickly find embeddings similar to a query embedding.
Scalability: Handle large volumes of data.
### 4. Enhancing the Knowledge Graph
#### 4.1 Mapping Social Media Items to Retailer Catalog
Embedding Comparison:
Compute Similarity: Compare embeddings from social media images to embeddings of retailer's products.
Thresholding: Set similarity thresholds to determine matches.
Updating the KG:
Nodes: Add or update nodes representing retailer's products.
Edges: Strengthen edges between items that co-occur in social media images.
Edge Weights: Increase weights based on frequency or recency.
#### 4.2 Inferring Relationships
Co-Occurrence Analysis:
Method: Items frequently appearing together are likely to be stylistically compatible.
Edge Creation: Create or strengthen :WORN_WITH or :COMPLEMENTS relationships.
Temporal Trends:
Trend Detection: Identify emerging fashion trends by monitoring changes over time.
Edge Attributes: Add timestamps or trend scores to edges.
### 5. Generating Complete Outfits
#### 5.1 User Selection
Starting Point: User selects an item from the retailer's catalog.
#### 5.2 Retrieving Recommendations
Step 1: Retrieve the embedding of the selected item.
Step 2: Query the vector database to find similar items in social media embeddings.
Step 3: Identify co-occurring items in social media images.
Step 4: Map these items back to the retailer's catalog using embedding similarity.
#### 5.3 Assembling the Outfit
Knowledge Graph Traversal:
Traverse: Use the KG to find items connected to the selected product.
Edge Weights: Prioritize items with stronger relationships.
Attribute Matching:
Compatibility: Ensure recommended items match in style, color, and occasion.
Personalization (Optional):
User Preferences: Incorporate user data to tailor recommendations.
Contextual Filters: Apply filters like season or trending styles.
### 6. The Role of Social Media Images
Authenticity: Social media images reflect real-world fashion trends.
Diversity: Provides a wide range of styles and combinations.
Trendiness: Keeps the recommendations up-to-date with current fashions.
