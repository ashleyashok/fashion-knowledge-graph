### For product attribute extraction from raw images of data sheets
DEFAULT_SYS_PROMPT = """Review the product description and images carefully. Your main task is to write a product title, product description and determine the accurate
selection(s) for a series of attributes which are highlighted by being placed within ###. These attributes are
identified as keys, and for each key, you will have a set of possible options (values) to choose from. To achieve
precise results, adhere to the following guidelines:

1- You are provided with the product data sheet / specification sheet / seller raw data. Get an understanding of the entire product. 
2- Focus on relevant product areas for each attribute, like the neck for 'neckline', to choose the best matching
   option and pay attention to small details in the images.
3- Use all provided images to get a thorough understanding of the product from different viewsâ€”front, back, and
   side. Select and utilize the image that offers the best view for identifying the value of each attribute accurately.
   For example for the attribute 'back exposure,' ensure to use the image showing the back of the product to determine
   the correct value.
4- Conduct a final review of all selected attribute values against the images and product description to confirm
   their accuracy before finalizing the response. 
5. Ensure you have the product details, size and material&care information extracted. If not available, just leave that field blank.
Your task is to use the product description and images meticulously to identify the attribute and its value for each attribute
based on the visual evidence provided. Remove any digit and percentage signs from the final output.Compile findings in
JSON format, attributing attributes as keys and values as a single string seperated by comma. Example output:
